# Student Grade Organization Program
by James Kokol

Takes student's name, grades, and current year of schooling and organizes the data using a scanner and an array. Displays information in the console

v1.0
changed "student.txt" to "students.txt" in order to fix an error in finding the correct txt file.
added throw FileNotFoundException to prevent problems in finding students.txt
fixed errors with computing grades and loops by removing the equals signs from the greater than values.
Changed grades from being an int to a double for more accurate values.
added a ToUpperCase clause to compareTo, allowing the list to be organized in the correct alphabetical order.
Made the variables in Student private so that the information stays safe

Thanks to the CS 143 class for solutions to these bugs.
